# Quadrotar_Dynamics
## Simulations
Used Simulink for the sake of 3D simulations and graphs are drawn with use of MATLAB
## Trajectory_Planning
Used Dijkstra's algorithm for in rder to find the shortest path , you can observe different paths in the trajectories folder
## Quadcoptor
Used the UAV_RoboKit of MATLAB for accessing the aerodynamics of drone while flying and orientation of the drone , we can clearly see the drone flying around avoiding the obstacles in the path
